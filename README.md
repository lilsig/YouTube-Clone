This is a project originally created and taught by Simon Bao of SuperSimpleDev at https://supersimple.dev/. This course includes exercises to practice HTML and CSS, which I have completed in the "HTML CSS Practice Problems" folder, in order to showcase my understanding of these languages. Additionally, this course includes code also originally created by SuperSimpleDev of a Youtube Home Page clone, which applies the skills learned in the course. Everyday this repository will be updated until lessons 1-17 are complete, and the Youtube Home Page Clone is complete.
